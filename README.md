# SAFEreadme# SAFE ‚Äì Snowflake Access Flow Evaluator

> Project under development ‚Äì name subject to change.

## Overview

SAFE is a Streamlit-based application designed to help Snowflake account administrators and users evaluate whether their current authentication methods are compliant with upcoming changes to Snowflake's password and MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) policies.

This tool queries Snowflake account metadata and login history to flag users and service accounts that may need to update their authentication methods‚Äîsuch as switching from basic auth to supported MFA mechanisms.

## Key Features

- Identifies users who are still using password-based login without MFA
- üîçHighlights service accounts that may break due to upcoming enforcement
- Provides a clear dashboard view of authentication factors across your Snowflake environment
-  Lightweight and quick to deploy using Streamlit

## Use Case

Snowflake will soon enforce stricter requirements on user authentication. SAFE helps you get ahead of the curve by:

- Running checks against `login_history` and `users` tables
- Flagging non-compliant authentication flows
- Helping you plan user remediation or automation updates

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Snowflake account with `ACCOUNTADMIN` or sufficient privileges to query `login_history` and `users`
- [Snowflake Python Connector](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector)
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- `.env` file or secrets manager for credentials

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/safe.git
